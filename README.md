# social-media

A web application to share your favourite music, movies and TV shows with friends and family.

## APIs

The first hurdle will be figuring out what apis are I will need access to.

### Movie and TV API

My first idea for movies and TV will be
`https://imdb-api.com/`
It appears to be free as long as we don't exceed 100 api calls a day. After this point we will be charged.

### Music API

For music I will most likely use the `https://www.last.fm/api` as it is free and has the meta data we need.

### Podcast API

For podcasts I will use `https://www.listennotes.com/api/docs/`

We may need another Api for anime but the imdb database seems to have common titles.

## Inspiration

The inspiration is the website MyAnimeList which allows users to rate, comment and compare anime and manga with each other. User ratings are agregated creating a tiered list of the most popular anime in the world.

Though I didn't use the website as a way to meet like minded fans, I found user discussions and recommendations extremely helpful in the past.

I've always wondered how effective a similar website would be if it had a wider scope then anime.

## Functionality

Users of the application will sign up and create an account. After this they can search for media they have liked and disliked and give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down. If they haven't seen it they will also be able to show whether they are interested in it in future.

The user will then send a friend request to friends and family and be able to share their interests with each other.

Though other social media platforms offer a similar service, I want ours to be primarily focussed on sharing thoughts and feelings about media, not the users personal life.

## Technologies

The application will be developed in Typescript and Node. The front end will be in the NextJs framework and the backend will be Mongo and Express.
